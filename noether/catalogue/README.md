# Noether: Unit catalogue
With the exception of the base SI units and dimensions, all units and dimensions are defined in this catalogue.

Logical subsections of files use `# %` comments.

Wherever a unit or constant is measured and explicitly defined by a standard, its source is provided (and whether it is *fixed* by definition):

- The *Committee on Data of the International Science Council* issue **CODATA** reports for scientific constants. *Latest used: CODATA 2018*
- The *General Conference on Weights and Measures* (**GCWM**) meet to define the SI units. *Latest used: 27th meeting (2022)*.
