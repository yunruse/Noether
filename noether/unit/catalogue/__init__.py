"""
noether: Catalogue of units and dimensions

This module intends to catalogue _every_ unit and dimension that is
possibly known or ever has been known.
It is explicitly coded in Python, as opposed to a config file,
so as to be as legible in how it expresses relations to other units.
The submodule is defined in sectioned files only for convenience â€“
do not directly import from them.
